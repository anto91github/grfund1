						Don’t use music, images, video, or other content that you don’t have the rights to. Using copyrighted material is almost always against the law and can lead to expensive lawsuits down the road.<br/>
When copyright disputes do arise on GoongRoyongFund (they’re rare, but they happen), we handle them in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. To avoid unnecessary disruption, projects in question are typically removed from public view but are not immediately canceled. This keeps pledge authorizations and lines of communication intact, and leaves room for project recovery where appropriate. The procedure is outlined in detail on our Copyright and DMCA Policy page.<br/>
The easiest way to avoid copyright troubles altogether, though, is to create all the content yourself or use content that is free for public use. For example, you may be able to use some Creative Commons-licensed music — per the terms of their licenses — that’s available on Sound Cloud. Other resources worth exploring: Vimeo, Music Store,Free Music Archive and ccMixter.</div>

						It is the responsibility of the project creator to fulfill the promises of their project. GotongRoyongFund reviews projects to ensure they do not violate the project guidelines, however GotongRoyongFund does not investigate a creator’s ability to complete their project.<br/>
Creators are encouraged to share links to any websites that show work related to the project, or past projects. It’s up to them to make the case for their project and their ability to complete it. Because projects are usually funded by the friends, fans, and communities around its creator, there are powerful social forces that keep creators accountable.<br/>
The web is an excellent resource for learning about someone’s prior experience. If someone has no demonstrable prior history of doing something like their project, or is unwilling to share information, backers should consider that when weighing a pledge. If something sounds too good to be true, it very well may be.</div>

						 What happen a project is over funded?</a>

					<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="34" style="height: 0px;">
					  <div class="panel-body">
						When a project is over funded backers sometimes wonder: what happens with all that “extra” money? If a creator has a funding goal of $5,000 and raises $25,000, what do they do with the $20,000 they didn’t ask for?<br/>
What the creator does in that case varies greatly depending on the project.<br/>
Most of the time what seems like “extra” money isn’t extra at all. Ten times the funding often means ten times the backers. More rewards have to be produced and distributed, and creators need that funding to do it (and sometimes some of their own money too).<br/>
Sometimes when a project is over funded it lets the creator put that money back into the project to create something better for the backers and themselves. More songs on an album, additional game elements, better materials, etc.<br/>
In other cases, over funding leads to better margins and the creator may even profit from the project.</div>

						Perhaps you know the project creator, or you heard about the project from a trusted source.<br/>
Maybe they have a first-person video. That would be hard to fake.<br/>
Still not sure? Check the creator bio section on the project page for some background. Have they connected their Facebook account? Does the creator provide links for further verification?<br/>
In the creator’s full bio, look for the verified name, next to a check mark. This person is the creator of the project or a part of the company or team behind it, and they verified their identity through an automated process.<br/>
The web is an invaluable resource for learning more about a person. At the end of the day, use your internet street smarts.</div>
